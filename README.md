# Password Generator Starter Code

## Purpose
A random password generator created to allow a user to provide components of their choosing.  These included upper case letters, lower case letters, symbols, and numbers.  Code length was allowed to be specified per user preference to between 8 and 128 characters long.  If the user failed to select any of the key components for the password, user was then prompted to re-attempt password generation.
